									<h3>How CEC Protects You</h3>
									<h4>A multi-layered approach:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Advanced Threat Detection:</strong> We use state-of-the-art technology to monitor our 
											systems for suspicious activity and potential threats. In addition, we have a team of talented 
											security engineers who work round-the-clock to monitor and respond to any threats.</li>
										<li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Our employees receive regular training on cybersecurity 
											best practices to ensure they are equipped to identify and respond to threats.</li>
										<li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> We encrypt sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized 
											access. No matter what, our first priority is to keep your information secure.</li>
										<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> We conduct regular security audits to identify and address 
											vulnerabilities in our systems. All our audits are conducted by certified third-parties.</li>
										<li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have a comprehensive incident response plan in place
											to quickly and effectively respond to any cybersecurity incidents. Our policy analysts assess 
											risks and coordinate with many different agencies on security issues.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Collaboration at Home and Abroad</h4>

										<p>Domestically, Carolina Electric Company works closely with the <strong style="color:rgb(28, 159, 202)">Cybersecurity 
										and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</strong>, the US Homeland Security Department's key organization 
										in charge of coordinating cybersecurity efforts across federal agencies and private sector partners. With 
										CISA's help, we stay informed of emerging threats and best practices in cybersecurity. We also share our 
										security engineers' and policy analysts' insights with CISA to improve overall cybersecurity posture. To 
										learn more about CISA's work, visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">their website</a>.</p>

										<p>Internationally, we collaborate with the <strong style="color:rgb(28, 159, 202)">International 
										Telecommunications Union (ITU)</strong>, a specialized agency of the United Nations that focuses on 
										information and communication technologies. The ITU helps us stay informed of global cybersecurity trends 
										and best practices. Our security team keeps up-to-date with ITU's recommendations and best practices, 
										ensuring our cyber infrastructure remains secure. Just like with CISA, we regularly share reports on our 
										security insights with the ITU. This collaboration is a big part of our efforts to incorporate the world's 
										leading practices into our own cybersecurity strategy. Learn more about the ITU's work 
										<a href="https://www.itu.int/">here</a>.</p>

										<p>CEC also participates in joint cybersecurity initiatives with other energy companies both in the US and 
										abroad. We share threat intelligence, best practices, and security updates to help strengthen the overall 
										cybersecurity of the energy sector. These initiatives are coordinated through the <strong 
										style="color:rgb(28, 159, 202)">North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)</strong>, and other 
										international organizations. By sharing insights, we contribute to international coordination and greater 
										resilience in the global energy grid. Read more on NERC <a href="https://www.nerc.com/">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>How You Can Stay Safe</h3>
									<p>While CEC takes extensive measures to protect our systems and data, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 
									Here are some tips to help you stay safe online:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create unique passwords for each of your accounts, and use a 
											password manager to keep track of them.</li>
										<li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication 
											for an extra layer of security on your accounts.</li>
										<li><strong>Be Cautious with Emails:</strong> Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those that ask for 
											personal information or contain links. Always verify the sender's identity before clicking on any 
											links or downloading attachments.</li>
										<li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, 
											and other applications to protect against the latest threats.</li>
										<li><strong>Secure Your Home Network:</strong> Use a strong password for your Wi-Fi network and consider 
											setting up a guest network for visitors to keep your main network more secure.</li>
										<li><strong>Beware Phone Scams:</strong> CEC will never ask you for your account information or your credit
											card information over the phone. If you receive such a call, hang up and contact CEC directly using 
											official contact methods.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Remember: cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Here at CEC, we do our best to keep our systems and you 
									secure. But you hold the final responsibility for protecting your own data and devices. By following these best 
									practices, you can help protect yourself and your data from cyber threats. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and 
									stay safe online!</p>

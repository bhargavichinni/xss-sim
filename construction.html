									<h2>What to do When CEC is Constructing</h2>

									<p>Contractors and construction workers are constantly surrounded by electricity and 
									natural gas on work sites. Carolina Electric Company wants to make sure workers  
									avoid hazards by practicing some basic safety rules while working around overhead  
									and underground utility lines.</p>

									<p>As a resident, your safety is our number one priority. If you see any construction 
									activity near your property, please be careful and allow our employees to do their work 
									safely. Occasionally, we may send employees or authorized contractors to your home to 
									perform meter work or some other service. Please remember the following safety tips to 
									protect yourself and our workers.</p>

									<h3>How to stay safe when construction is happening near you</h3>
									<h4>Identifying a Carolina Electric Company Employee</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Carolina Electric Company employees wear a company logo on their work clothes.</li>
										<li>They carry a company ID badge that can be shown to you upon request. Each 
											employee has a different colored badge corresponding to the utility they are working 
											with, and each badge has a unique ID number that can be verified by calling us.</li>
										<li>In some instances, representatives from private companies may be working in your area 
											on behalf of Carolina Electric. If they do not have an official identification card, 
											ask for their name and the reason for their visit, and then contact us to verify the 
											information. </li>
										<li>Never let anyone into your home or property without verifying their identity and reason  
											for being there. If you are unsure, please call us immediately.</li>
										<li>Carolina Electric Company does not charge customers for tree-trimming work performed in 
											your area that falls within our scope of work. Our employees will not ask for payment or 
											tips for any work they perform. If you are asked for any form of payment, please report 
											it to us immediately.</li>
										<li>If you believe the person is not a legitimate Carolina Electric employee, contact Carolina 
											Electric Comapny to verify the visit. If you feel in danger or have verified that the person 
											is not a CEC employee, call the police immediately.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h4>General Safety Tips</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Always keep a safe distance from overhead power lines and underground utility lines.</li>
										<li>Never touch or attempt to move any utility lines or equipment.</li>
										<li>If you see any downed power lines, do not approach them. Call us immediately.</li>
										<li>Do not use any tools or equipment near power lines without proper clearance.</li>
										<li>Be aware of your surroundings and report any unsafe conditions to us immediately.</li>
										<li>Follow all safety signs and instructions provided by our employees or contractors.</li>
										<li>Don't allow children to climb trees growing near power lines. </li>
										<li>If caught inside a vehicle with a power line that has fallen on it, you should wait inside 
											for help and warn others to stay away. It's better to stay inside the vehicle until emergency 
											help arrives, but if immediate escape is necessary, tell children and any other occupants to 
											jump clear without touching the ground and the vehicle at the same time. </li>
									</ul>

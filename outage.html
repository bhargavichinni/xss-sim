						<p>Losing power can be scary! Luckily, we've prepared a guide to help you stay safe and informed 
						during an outage. Read below for some standard procedures on how to best handle an outage. If you
						have a question specific to your situation, please contact us. <i><strong style="color:rgb(28, 159, 202)"> 
						If you are in a life-threatening emergency, please call 911 immediately.</strong></i></p>

								<h3 id="fallen">Fallen lines or other safety hazards</h3>
								<p>If you see a fallen power line or any other safety hazard, do not touch it. Stay at least 10 feet 
								away and contact your local emergency services immediately. Keep others away from the area until help 
								arrives. When you are at a safe distance, report the incident online or by calling 1-800-769-3766. If 
								you are signed up for our emergency alerts, you will be notified of any outage that results from this
								incident. We will also notify you when the power line is restored and the hazard is cleared.</p>

									<h3 id="waiting">While waiting for power to be restored...</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Confirm and report the outage.</strong> Check if the outage is affecting your area by looking at the 
										outage map or contacting us. Look outside for lights or call neighbors to verify if it is just your home that is 
										affected or if the outage is across your entire neighborhood. When you are sure, report the outage online or by 
										calling 1-800-769-3766. We can provide updates on the situation and estimated restoration times</li>
										<li><strong>Keep refrigerators and freezers closed.</strong> This will help preserve the food inside and reduce 
										the risk of spoilage. A closed refrigerator will keep food safe for up to 4 hours, while a full freezer can 
										last for 48 hours.</li>
										<li><strong>Unplug non-essential electronics and appliances.</strong> This protects them from power surges when 
										the power is restored.</li>
										<li><strong>Use flashlights instead of candles.</strong> This reduces the risk of fire. Try and locate extra 
										batteries for your flashlights if possible.</li>
										<li><strong>Stay informed.</strong> Listen to a battery-powered radio or use your mobile device to get updates 
										from local news and Carolina Electric Company. If you have a car, you can also use its radio to stay informed.</li>
										<li><strong>Conserve phone battery.</strong> Use your phone only for essential calls and texts to preserve battery 
										life for as long as possible. If you have a battery pack, use it to extend your phone's battery life.</li>
										<li><strong>Stay cool or warm.</strong> Dress appropriately for the weather. In hot weather, stay hydrated and seek 
										shade. In cold weather, wear layers and use blankets to stay warm.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3 id="restored">After power is restored...</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Check your appliances and electronics.</strong> Make sure they are functioning properly. If you notice 
										any issues, contact a professional for repairs.</li>
										<li><strong>Restock your emergency supplies.</strong> Replace any items you used during the outage, such as batteries, 
										flashlights, and non-perishable food.</li>
										<li><strong>Review your outage experience.</strong> Take note of what worked well and what could be improved for future 
										outages. This can help you better prepare for any future incidents.</li>
										<li><strong>Report any issues.</strong> If you notice any damage to your property due to fallen power lines or other hazards,
										report it to us immediately. Our team will respond promptly to address any concerns. For more information on our construction 
										and restoration efforts, visit our <a href="construction.html">Construction</a> page.</li>

											<ul>
												<li><strong>Create an emergency kit.</strong> Include items such as flashlights, batteries, non-perishable food, water, 
												a first aid kit, and any necessary medications.</li>
												<li><strong>Develop a family communication plan.</strong> Ensure all family members know how to contact each other and where 
												to meet in case of an emergency.</li>
												<li><strong>Stay informed about weather conditions.</strong> Monitor local news and weather reports to stay aware of any 
												potential severe weather that could lead to power outages. Review our <a href="weather.html">Extreme Weather</a> page for 
												more information on how to prepare for storms.</li>
												<li><strong>Consider backup power options.</strong> If you live in an area prone to frequent outages, consider investing in a 
												generator or solar-powered charger to keep essential devices powered during an outage.</li>

									<h3 id="process">How we restore power</h3>
									<p>Carolina Electric Company focuses on restoring power in a sequence that enables power restoration to 
									public health and safety facilities and to the greatest number of customers as safely and quickly as possible. 
									We follow a systematic approach to restore power after an outage that begins with our teams assessing the 
									damage and identifying the source of the problem. Then, they work to repair or replace damaged equipment and 
									restore power to affected areas in a timely manner.</p>
									<p>When restoring power, we prioritize restoring power to critical facilities first, such as hospitals and 
									ems stations. After that, we focus on restoring power to the greatest number of customers as safely and 
									quickly as possible. Emphasis is placed on vital public health and safety facilities such as hospitals, law 
									enforcement, fire departments, water treatment facilities and pumping stations. Efforts to restore power to 
									these facilities are clearly essential to protect the health and safety of the public.</p>
									<p>Carolina Electric Company prepares well in advance when severe weather threatens our area. To learn more
									about how we respond to severe weather events, visit our <a href="weather.html">Extreme Weather</a> page.</p>
